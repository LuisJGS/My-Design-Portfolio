        <h1 class="design-title">About Me</h1>
        <p class="info">My name is Luis Jovanny Garcia Sanchez. I am from Puerto Rico, born and raised, and located in Central Florida. I am a very dedicated and family-oriented person. I take pride in the work I do and how I do it, I can say I always leave a good impression with my work. I finished my bachelor’s degree in computer science from SNHU at the end of 2022. To add to my bachelor, I completed Google’s UX design certificate and IBM Enterprise Design Thinking certificate.</p>
        <p class="info">Before deciding to jump into the technology field, I used to work with customers, finding ways to provide the users with the best possible experience with their internet and TV services. This included designing cable routes, listening to the pain points and solving problems my customers had at that moment. I also was the owner of my cable installation company. We were a group of 3, where my leadership helped us find and complete projects with construction companies and small businesses.</p>
        <p class="info">I also have been working as an IT for the last 2 years with a top 500 company. Here we managed and supported restaurants’ hardware and software. I was the leader and project manager for small projects that’s help shape and improve the IT help desk team.
        <p class="info">I am looking for a UX/UI designer role, as I have had experience before interviewing users, learning their pain points, creating solutions, creating prototypes, wireframing and completing a case study for different projects. Also, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS as well. I created my portfolio using these 2 technologies. I am looking forward to learning JavaScript and becoming a full front-end developer. My goal is to be able to design and build solutions that help others with their daily lives.</p>
